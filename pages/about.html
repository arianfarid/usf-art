                    <p>This app was made by AIST of the University of South Florida to showcase
                    and facilitate appreciation for the public art on the Tampa Campus, and to
                    provide context for each of the pieces.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Though there are installations inside certain buildings, in order for a GPS-based
                    app such as this to properly display information for such pieces, only the outside
                    installations have been considered for the production of this app.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p>Where appropiate, information on each piece is cited at the bottom of the article.
                    Varouis sources have been used, including electronic and physical resources. </p>
